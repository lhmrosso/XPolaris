Description: The POLARIS database <http://hydrology.cee.duke.edu/POLARIS/> 
    is a 30-meter probabilistic soil series map of the contiguous United 
    States (US). It represents an optimization of the Soil Survey 
    Geographic database. This R package facilitates the access 
    to large amounts of soil data within the US, currently 
    stored online as raster images (TIFF).
